# Core information about functional programming
In this repo I collected several useful termins, examples and other things which are related to functional programming

## Pure/impure functions

Characteristics of Pure Function:

* The return value of the pure func­tions solely depends on its arguments Hence, if you call the pure functions with the same set of argu­ments, you will always get the same return values.
* They do not have any side effects like net­work or data­base calls
* They do not mod­ify the argu­ments which are passed to them

Characteristics of Impure functions

* The return value of the impure func­tions does not solely depend on its arguments Hence, if you call the impure func­tions with the same set of argu­ments, you might get the dif­fer­ent return values For exam­ple, Math.random(), Date.now()
* They may have any side effects like net­work or data­base calls
* They may mod­ify the argu­ments which are passed to them
